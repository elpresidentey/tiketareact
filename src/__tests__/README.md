# Test Suite Documentation

This document provides an overview of the comprehensive test suite implemented for the ticket management application.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests
- **Components**: Tests for individual React components
  - `LoginForm.test.tsx`: Tests login form functionality, validation, and user interactions
  - `TicketCard.test.tsx`: Tests ticket display, status changes, and CRUD operations
  
- **Stores**: Tests for Zustand state management
  - `authStore.test.ts`: Tests authentication logic, login/signup flows, and session management
  - `ticketStore.test.ts`: Tests ticket CRUD operations and state management

### Integration Tests
- **Authentication Flow**: End-to-end authentication testing
  - Login flow with valid/invalid credentials
  - Signup flow with validation
  - Form switching between login and signup
  
- **Ticket CRUD Operations**: Complete ticket lifecycle testing
  - Ticket creation with validation
  - Ticket updates and status changes
  - Ticket deletion with confirmation
  - Search and filtering functionality

### Accessibility Tests
- **axe-core Integration**: Automated accessibility testing
  - Tests for WCAG compliance
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Color contrast validation

### End-to-End Tests
- **User Journeys**: Complete user workflow testing
  - New user registration and onboarding
  - Login to ticket management workflow
  - Complete ticket lifecycle from creation to deletion

## Test Configuration

### Setup Files
- `src/test/setup.ts`: Global test configuration and mocks
- `src/test/utils.tsx`: Custom render functions and test utilities
- `vite.config.ts`: Vitest configuration with jsdom environment

### Dependencies
- **Vitest**: Test runner and framework
- **@testing-library/react**: React component testing utilities
- **@testing-library/user-event**: User interaction simulation
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Additional DOM matchers
- **jest-axe**: Accessibility testing with axe-core
- **jsdom**: DOM environment for testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/components/__tests__/LoginForm.test.tsx
```

## Test Coverage Areas

### Core Functionality
✅ User authentication (login/signup)
✅ Ticket CRUD operations
✅ Form validation
✅ State management
✅ Error handling
✅ Loading states

### User Experience
✅ Accessibility compliance
✅ Keyboard navigation
✅ Screen reader support
✅ Responsive design validation
✅ User feedback (toasts, errors)

### Integration Points
✅ Component interaction
✅ Store integration
✅ Router navigation
✅ LocalStorage operations
✅ Form submissions

## Mock Strategy

### External Dependencies
- **LocalStorage**: Mocked for consistent test environment
- **React Router**: Mocked for navigation testing
- **Notifications**: Mocked toast notifications
- **Network Simulation**: Mocked async operations

### Test Data
- Mock user objects with realistic data
- Mock ticket objects with various states
- Predefined test scenarios for edge cases

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolated Testing**: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on others
2. **Realistic Mocking**: Mocks simulate real behavior without over-mocking
3. **User-Centric Testing**: Tests focus on user interactions and outcomes
4. **Accessibility First**: All components tested for accessibility compliance
5. **Error Scenarios**: Tests cover both success and failure paths
6. **Performance Considerations**: Tests run efficiently with minimal setup

## Future Enhancements

- Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- API integration testing when backend is available
- Load testing for concurrent user scenarios

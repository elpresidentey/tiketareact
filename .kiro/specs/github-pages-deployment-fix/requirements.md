# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the blank screen issue when the ticket management web application is deployed to GitHub Pages. The application currently fails to load properly on GitHub Pages, preventing users from accessing the deployed version of the application.

## Glossary

- **GitHub Pages**: GitHub's static site hosting service that serves web applications from a repository
- **Deployment Pipeline**: The automated CI/CD workflow that builds and deploys the application to GitHub Pages
- **Base Path**: The URL path prefix required for GitHub Pages deployment (typically the repository name)
- **Asset Resolution**: The process of correctly loading CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets in the deployed environment
- **Routing System**: The client-side navigation system that handles URL changes and page rendering
- **Build Artifacts**: The compiled and optimized files generated during the build process for deployment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the GitHub Pages URL, I want to see the application load correctly, so that I can access and use the ticket management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the GitHub Pages URL, THE Deployment Pipeline SHALL serve the application without displaying a blank screen
2. WHEN the application loads on GitHub Pages, THE Routing System SHALL correctly handle the base path configuration
3. WHEN assets are requested, THE Asset Resolution SHALL load all CSS, JavaScript, and image files successfully
4. WHEN the initial page renders, THE Application SHALL display the landing page or appropriate authenticated view
5. WHERE the user has a direct URL to a specific route, THE Routing System SHALL handle deep linking correctly on GitHub Pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the application, I want the build process to generate correctly configured assets, so that the deployment works seamlessly on GitHub Pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs, THE Build Artifacts SHALL include properly configured asset paths for GitHub Pages
2. WHEN the deployment workflow executes, THE Deployment Pipeline SHALL successfully complete all build steps without errors
3. WHEN assets are bundled, THE Build Artifacts SHALL reference the correct base path for the GitHub Pages environment
4. IF the build process encounters test failures, THEN THE Deployment Pipeline SHALL handle the failures gracefully and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN the build completes, THE Build Artifacts SHALL be optimized for production deployment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application on GitHub Pages, I want all routes to work correctly, so that I can access different pages and features without encountering 404 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks navigation links, THE Routing System SHALL navigate to the correct pages without 404 errors
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page on any route, THE GitHub Pages SHALL serve the application correctly
3. WHEN a user accesses a direct URL to any application route, THE Routing System SHALL render the appropriate page
4. WHILE navigating between authenticated and public routes, THE Routing System SHALL maintain proper access control
5. IF a user accesses an invalid route, THEN THE Routing System SHALL redirect to the appropriate fallback page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring the deployment, I want clear visibility into deployment status and any issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment workflow runs, THE Deployment Pipeline SHALL provide clear status updates and logs
2. IF deployment fails, THEN THE Deployment Pipeline SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the failure cause
3. WHEN the deployment succeeds, THE Deployment Pipeline SHALL confirm successful deployment with the live URL
4. WHEN investigating issues, THE Build Artifacts SHALL include source maps and debugging information when needed
5. WHERE deployment configuration needs updates, THE Deployment Pipeline SHALL validate configuration changes before deployment

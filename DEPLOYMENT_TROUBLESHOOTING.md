# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ Build works locally
- ✅ Correct base path configured (`/tiketareact/`)
- ✅ Using HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
- ❌ GitHub Actions deployment failing

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### 1. Repository Settings
Check GitHub repository settings:
- Go to Settings > Pages
- Ensure Source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Not "Deploy from a branch"

### 2. Workflow Permissions
The workflow needs these permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Repository might need "github-pages" environment:
- Go to Settings > Environments
- Create "github-pages" environment if missing

### 4. Alternative Deployment
If standard workflow fails, try the simple-deploy.yml:
- Uses JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action
- Deploys to gh-pages branch
- More reliable for some repositories

## Quick Fixes to Try

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in Settings**
2. **Check workflow logs for specific errors**
3. **Try the simple-deploy workflow**
4. **Verify repository permissions**

## Manual Deployment (Last Resort)
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder manually to gh-pages branch
```
